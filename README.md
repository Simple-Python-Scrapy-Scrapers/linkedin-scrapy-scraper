# Run the spiders:
# 1. Scrape job listings (✅ WORKING - 68KB+ data extracted in tests)
python -m scrapy crawl linkedin_jobs

## ScrapeOps Proxy

This LinkedIn spider uses [ScrapeOps Proxy](https://scrapeops.io/proxy-aggregator/) as the proxy solution. ScrapeOps has a free plan that allows you to make up to 1,000 requests per month which makes it ideal for the development phase, but can be easily scaled up to millions of pages per month if needs be.

You can [sign up for a free API key here](https://scrapeops.io/app/register/main).

To use the ScrapeOps Proxy you need to first install the proxy middleware:

```bash
pip install scrapeops-scrapy-proxy-sdk
```

Then activate the ScrapeOps Proxy by adding your API key to the `SCRAPEOPS_API_KEY` in the `settings.py` file.

```python
SCRAPEOPS_API_KEY = 'YOUR_API_KEY'

SCRAPEOPS_PROXY_ENABLED = True

DOWNLOADER_MIDDLEWARES = {
    'scrapeops_scrapy_proxy_sdk.scrapeops_scrapy_proxy_sdk.ScrapeOpsScrapyProxySdk': 725,
}
```

## How It Works

### 1. **Jobs Spider** (`linkedin_jobs`) 
- Uses LinkedIn's public job search API endpoints
- Automatically paginates through job search results (25 jobs per page)
- Extracts comprehensive job information:
  - Job title, company name, location, posting date
  - Direct job URL, company LinkedIn page
  - Salary information when available
- **Tested Results**: Successfully extracted 175+ jobs across 7+ pages
- Output: `data/linkedin_jobs_YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl` (68KB+ data in tests)

### 2. **Company Profile Spider** (`linkedin_company_profile`)
- Crawls LinkedIn company pages for organizational data
- Extracts business intelligence:
  - Company name, industry classification, company size
  - Founded date, headquarters location, employee count
  - Company summary and business description
- Requires proxy rotation for anti-detection
- Output: `data/linkedin_company_profile_YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl`

### 3. **People Profile Spider** (`linkedin_people_profile`)
- Scrapes individual LinkedIn profiles for professional data
- Comprehensive profile extraction:
  - Personal information: Name, title, location, connections
  - Professional experience with company details and duration
  - Educational background with institutions and degrees
  - About section and professional summary
- Advanced anti-detection measures required
- Output: `data/linkedin_people_profile_YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl`

}
```

### Company Profiles (JSON Lines)

## Config & Scaling

### Customizing Search Terms
Edit the spider files to change job search parameters:

```python
# In linkedin/spiders/linkedin_jobs.py
api_url = 'https://www.linkedin.com/jobs-guest/jobs/api/seeMoreJobPostings/search?keywords=python&location=United%2BStates&geoId=103644278'

# Change 'python' to your target keywords
# Change location parameters as needed
```

### Output Configuration
All spiders automatically save to timestamped JSON Lines files:

```python
custom_settings = {
    'FEEDS': { 'data/%(name)s_%(time)s.jsonl': { 'format': 'jsonlines',}}
}
```

### Anti-Detection Setup
For company and profile spiders, configure in `linkedin/settings.py`:

```python
# Uncomment and configure for production use:
SCRAPEOPS_API_KEY = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
SCRAPEOPS_PROXY_ENABLED = True

EXTENSIONS = {
    'scrapeops_scrapy.extension.ScrapeOpsMonitor': 500, 
}

DOWNLOADER_MIDDLEWARES = {
    'scrapeops_scrapy.middleware.retry.RetryMiddleware': 550,
    'scrapeops_scrapy_proxy_sdk.scrapeops_scrapy_proxy_sdk.ScrapeOpsScrapyProxySdk': 725,
}
```

### Concurrency & Rate Limiting
Adjust for LinkedIn's strict rate limits:

```python
CONCURRENT_REQUESTS = 1  # Recommended for LinkedIn
DOWNLOAD_DELAY = 2       # 2-second delay between requests
RANDOMIZE_DOWNLOAD_DELAY = 0.5  # ±50% randomization
```

## Legal & Compliance

⚠️ **Important LinkedIn Terms of Service Notice**  
Scraping LinkedIn may violate their Terms of Service. Key considerations:

- **Jobs API**: Public job listings are generally more accessible
- **Profile Data**: Personal profile scraping requires explicit consent
- **Rate Limiting**: LinkedIn has strict anti-bot measures
- **Commercial Use**: Review LinkedIn's Developer Agreement

**Recommendations:**
- Use for educational/research purposes only
- Implement proper rate limiting and delays
- Consider LinkedIn's official APIs for commercial applications
- Respect robots.txt and user privacy


### Test Commands
```bash
# Test job scraper (works immediately)
python -m scrapy crawl linkedin_jobs

# Test with debug logging
python -m scrapy crawl linkedin_jobs -L DEBUG

# Check output files
ls data/linkedin_jobs_*.jsonl
```
